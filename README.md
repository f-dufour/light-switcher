# Light-switcher description

A modest Apple Script that enables the easy switch between macOS "light" and "dark" built-in modes.

![Icon](./Ressources/Icon.png)

# Use

Lauch the script via Script Editor (.scpt file) or the compiled app (.app file) and choose your mode !

![Dialog box](./Ressources/dialog_box.png)

Note that the compiled app is dockable.

# TO DO

* Improve the app icon.
* Add a "Dismiss" button that exits the app with no changes.
* Add a switch in the upper banner of the screen (that way, it will be easily accessible).
* Maybe: Make the code look more sexy (?)
