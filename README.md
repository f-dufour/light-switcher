Lauch the script via Script Editor (.scpt file) or the compiled app (.app file) and choose your mode !

![Dialog box](./Ressources/dialog_box.png)

Note that the compiled app is dockable.

# TO DO

* Add a "Dismiss" button that exits the app with no changes or even a red cross at the top of the window (*is that possible with apple scrit ?*).
* Add a switch in the upper banner of the screen (that way, it will be easily accessible).
